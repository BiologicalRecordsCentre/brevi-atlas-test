# Initial steps
TODO - this page will take you through the initial steps of creating your own local website from the BRC GitHub repository by forking the repository and linking it to a GitHub pages site.





## Updating your project with the latest code
On the home page of your forked repo, you may see a notice like the one shown below. It indicates two things:
1. that this branch (i.e. your forked repo) is a number of commits *ahead* of BRC's project site (from which it is forked) and
2. that this branch is a number of commits *behind* of BRC's project site.

The *commits ahead* are generated whenever you make configuration changes to your forked repo. These changes will never be propagated to the project repo, so we can expect this number to continue to grow during the lifetime of your project.

The *commits behind* are important - they indicate software updates that have been made to BRC's project site but which are not yet in your forked repo.
