# Site config options: user/config/site.txt
The file 'site.txt' is the main site configuration page which must be created by the site admin and placed in the folder `user/config`. The format in which the configuration options are laid out (described below) is known as 'yaml' (pronounced 'yamel'). Yaml files normally have a '.yml' exention, but this configuration file has the file extension '.txt' to make it easy to open and edit with any text editor.

The general format for configuration options is:
```
option_name: option_value
```
