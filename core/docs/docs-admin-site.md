# Site config options: user/config/site.txt
The file `site.txt` is the main site configuration page which must be created by the site admin and placed in the folder `user/config`. The format in which the configuration options are laid out (described below) is known as YAML (pronounced 'yamel'). YAML files normally have a '.yml' file extension, but this configuration file has the file extension '.txt' to make it easy to open and edit with any text editor.

The general format for configuration options is:
```
option_name: option_value
```
An example is:
```
name: Shropshire Earthworm Atlas
```

Some options are nested indicating a related group of options, e.g:
```
group_name:
  group_option_1_name: group_option_1_value
  group_option_2_name: group_option_2_value
```
And example is:
```
overview:
  height: 900
  vc: gb40
  hectad-grid: true
```
