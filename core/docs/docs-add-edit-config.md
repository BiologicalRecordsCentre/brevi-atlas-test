# Using GitHub to add/edit files
To configure your atlas, you add and edit files in the *user* folder of your forked repo. Other pages tell you how to create data files and what to add to configuration files, but this page will tell you how to add them to your repo and edit configuration files in your repo.

Note that when files are added, removed or edited in your GitHub repo, the changes are not instantly propagated to your website. *It can take a few minutes for changes to your repo to be reflected on your linked GitHub pages website.*

# Using Git
If you are a seasoned user of Git, it will likely be much more convenient for you to update your repo by using the Git command line rather than the GitHub interface. This can also overcome GitHub's limit on the number of files that can be uploaded in one go.

If you are not a Git user but would like to learn how to use it to modify and upload files in your repo rather than using the Git interface, then this section will give you some useful information and guidance on learning how to do that. But note that this is enirely optional - it is possible to manage your website entirely through the GitHub interface without using the Git command line.
