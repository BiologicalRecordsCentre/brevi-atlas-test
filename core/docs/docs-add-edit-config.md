# Using GitHub to add/edit files
To configure your atlas, you add and edit files in the *user* folder of your forked repo. Other pages tell you how to create data files and what to add to configuration files, but this page will tell you how to add them to your repo and edit configuration files in your repo.

Note that when files are added, removed or edited in your GitHub repo, the changes are not instantly propagated to your website. *It can take a few minutes for changes to your repo to be reflected on your linked GitHub pages website.*

## Adding a configuration file
There are two ways of creating a new file in your repo:

1. Create it first on your computer and then upload it.
2. Create it directly in the repo.

### Creating first and then uploading
To using the first method, first create a configuration file, e.g. *site.txt* on your own computer and, optionally, edit it with a plain text editor (e.g. Notepad on Windows) to include some configuration options.

Next, naviate to the place where you wish to upload the file in your GitHub repo. For the *site.txt* folder, this will be the *user/config* folder - simply click on the *user* folder from the homepage of your GitHub repo and then click again on the *config* folder: that opens the *config* folder. You will see a button near the top right of the page like this:

# Using Git
If you are a seasoned user of Git, it will likely be much more convenient for you to update your repo by using the Git command line rather than the GitHub interface. This can also overcome GitHub's limit on the number of files that can be uploaded in one go.

If you are not a Git user but would like to learn how to use it to modify and upload files in your repo rather than using the Git interface, then this section will give you some useful information and guidance on learning how to do that. But note that this is enirely optional - it is possible to manage your website entirely through the GitHub interface without using the Git command line.
