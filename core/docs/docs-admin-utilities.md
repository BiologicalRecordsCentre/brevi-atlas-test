# Using the admin utilities
This page explains how to use the admin utilities that are integrated into your website. These utilties often generate data but it is important to note that the data files are not generated directly in your repo. They are effectively generated and saved to files (or zipfiles) on your computer. Uploading the files to your repo is described in the document [*Using GitHub ot add/edit files*](./docs-add-edit-config.md).

So there is no need to worry that these admin utilities are publicly visible to anyone using your atlas website - anyone can use them, but only to generate data files from a CSV which they already have.

To reach the admin utilties, click on the gear wheel on the right of your website's footer:

That will take you to a list of utilities acessible by clicking on the corresponding button. These are each described below>
