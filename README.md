# Configurable atlas project

A repository for developing/testing ideas around customisable atlas project.

For information on the specification for, and progress on, this project, see this page on the [Minimum Viable Product](./core/docs/mvp.md).

For some notes around the demonstration of this project at the BRC Recording Groups conference at Wallingford in March 2024, see [this information page](./core/docs/conf2024.md).

## Documentation links

Note that until the first version is released, the documentation here will also be incomplete and under development.

This documenation is provided for site admins and the text in these pages often refers to *you*, i.e. the actual, or potential, site creator and administrator. Where the documentation refers to *users*, it means the people who will use your published atlas website.

No documetation is provided for atlas website users. It is intended that the atlas website facilities are intuitive and easy to use without instruction. If, as an admin, you feel that more documentation is required for your users, you can provide that in additional HTML or Markdown page(s) as described in the help page listed below.

- [Initial steps](./core/docs/docs-initial-steps.md)
- [Using GitHub to add/edit files](./core/docs/docs-add-edit-config.md)
- [Using the admin utilities](./core/docs/docs-admin-utilities.md) - this includes how to generate all the required data for your site (e.g. taxon list, map and chart data), from a CSV of biological records.
