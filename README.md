# Configurable atlas project

A repository for developing/testing ideas around customisable atlas project.

For information on the specification for, and progress on, this project, see this page on the [Minimum Viable Product](./core/docs/mvp.md).

For some notes around the demonstration of this project at the BRC Recording Groups conference at Wallingford in March 2024, see [this information page](./core/docs/conf2024.md).

## Documentation links

Note that until the first version is released, the documentation here will also be incomplete and under development.

This documenation is provided for site admins and the text in these pages often refers to *you*, i.e. the actual, or potential, site creator and administrator. Where the documentation refers to *users*, it means the people who will use your published atlas website.

No documetation is provided for atlas website users. It is intended that the atlas website facilities are intuitive and easy to use without instruction. If, as an admin, you feel that more documentation is required for your users, you can provide that in additional HTML or Markdown page(s) as described in the help page listed below.

## Overview of the main steps
The main steps to create your own configurable atlas, hosted on GitHub, from a spreadsheet of biological records are outline below with links to documents that provide details. There are four main steps:

1. Set up a GitHub repository & associated website
2. Configure the appearance of your website
3. Generate and upload biological record data for your website
4. Add further information required for your site

Step 1 must come first, but the order in which you carry out steps 2 and 3 is not important. Step 4 is best performed after steps 2 & 3.

### Set up a GitHub repository & website
Setting up the GitHub side of things deals with 'forking' the BRC GitHub project repository ('repo') into your own GitHub account and then setting up 'GitHub pages' on your forked repo to create your website.
- [GitHub setup](./core/docs/docs-github-setup.md)
### Configure the appearance of your website
Create, add and edit the main configuration file and associated resources (e.g. a logo image) that tailors the look of your website.
- [General site configuration](./core/docs/docs-site-config.md)
### Generate and upload biological record data
Use the utility on your new site to convert a spreadsheet of records into the mapping and charting data required by the site. These are generated on your own computer.
Upload these data to your GitHub repo.
- [Using the admin utilities](./core/docs/docs-admin-utilities.md) - this includes how to generate all the required data for your site (e.g. taxon list, map and chart data), from a CSV of biological records.
### Add further information 
Add any further configuration and  files required for your site, taxon images, species accounts, web pages.
- [Creating additional HTML or Markdown pages](./core/docs/docs-additional-pages.md)
- [Configuring gallery images](./core/docs/docs-image-gallery.md)
